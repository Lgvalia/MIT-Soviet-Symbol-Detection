# MIT-Soviet-Buildings-classification
This is repository which is built in collaboration with MIT trainers and MIT TOT attendees.

The project was done using RESNET50 pretrained model. 
End goal of the project was to identify soviet symbols in the images and blur those out. At this point only building classification is done, but in future steps we plan to use YOLO object detection to idetify and find soviet symbol in the picture and then blur it out.

This project can later serve as a basis to replicate same techniques to hide hate speeches in user uploaded images.
